3. Run `uv sync` within the text_2_sql directory to install dependencies.
4. Configure the .env file based on the provided sample
5. Generate a data dictionary for your target server using the instructions in `data_dictionary`.
6. Upload these data dictionaries to the relevant contains in your storage account. Wait for them to be automatically indexed.
