# Multi-Shot Text2SQL Component - Semantic Kernel

The implementation is written for [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) in Python, although it can easily be adapted for C#.

**The provided Semantic Kernel code implements Iterations 2, 3 & 4. This section of the repo is an archive of previous iterations. No updates or changes will be made.**

## Full Logical Flow for Vector Based Approach

The following diagram shows the logical flow within the Vector Based plugin. In an ideal scenario, the questions will follow the _Pre-Fetched Cache Results Path** which leads to the quickest answer generation. In cases where the question is not known, the plugin will fall back the other paths accordingly and generate the SQL query using the LLMs.

As the query cache is shared between users (no data is stored in the cache), a new user can benefit from the pre-mapped question and schema resolution in the index. There are multiple possible strategies for updating the query cache, see the possible options in the Text2SQL README.

**Database results were deliberately not stored within the cache. Storing them would have removed one of the key benefits of the Text2SQL plugin, the ability to get near-real time information inside a RAG application. Instead, the query is stored so that the most-recent results can be obtained quickly. Additionally, this retains the ability to apply Row or Column Level Security.**

## Previous Approaches

 - **Iteration 2:** Injection of a brief description of the available entities is injected into the prompt. This limits the number of tokens used and avoids filling the prompt with confusing schema information.
 - **Iteration 3:** Indexing the entity definitions in a vector database, such as AI Search, and querying it to retrieve the most relevant entities for the key terms from the query.
  - **Iteration 4:** Keeping an index of commonly asked questions and which schema / SQL query they resolve to - this index is generated by the LLM when it encounters a question that has not been previously asked. Additionally, indexing the entity definitions in a vector database, such as AI Search _(same as Iteration 3)_. First querying this index to see if a similar SQL query can be obtained _(if high probability of exact SQL query match, the results can be pre-fetched)_. If not, falling back to the schema index, and querying it to retrieve the most relevant entities for the key terms from the query.

### Complete Execution Time Comparison for Approaches

To compare the different in complete execution time, the following questions were tested 25 times each for 4 different approaches.

Approaches:
- Prompt-based Multi-Shot (Iteration 2)
- Vector-Based Multi-Shot (Iteration 3)
- Vector-Based Multi-Shot with Query Cache (Iteration 4)
- Vector-Based Multi-shot with Pre Run Query Cache (Iteration 4)

Questions:
- What is the total revenue in June 2008?
- Give me the total number of orders in 2008?
- Which country did had the highest number of orders in June 2008?

The graph below shows the response times for the experimentation on a Known Question Set (i.e. the cache has already been populated with the query mapping by the LLM). gpt-4o was used as the completion LLM for this experiment. The response time is the complete execution time including:

- Prompt Preparation
- Question Understanding
- Cache Index Requests _(if applicable)_
- SQL Query Execution
- Interpretation and generation of answer in the correct format

![Response Time Distribution](./../../images/Known%20Question%20Response%20Time.png "Response Time Distribution By Approach")

The vector-based cache approaches consistently outperform those that just use a Prompt-Based or Vector-Based approach by a significant margin. Given that it is highly likely the same Text2SQL questions will be repeated often, storing the question-sql mapping leads to **significant performance increases** that are beneficial, despite the initial additional latency (between 1 - 2 seconds from testing) when a question is asked the first time.

## Prompt Based SQL Plugin (Iteration 2)

This approach works well for a small number of entities (tested on up to 20 entities with hundreds of columns). It performed well on the testing, with correct metadata, we achieved 100% accuracy on the test set.

Whilst a simple and high performing approach, the downside of this approach is the increase in number of tokens as the number of entities increases. Additionally, we found that the LLM started to get "confused" on which columns belong to which entities as the number of entities increased.

## Vector Based SQL Plugin (Iterations 3 & 4)

This approach allows the system to scale without significantly increasing the number of tokens used within the system prompt. Indexing and running an AI Search instance consumes additional cost, compared to the prompt based approach.

If the query cache is enabled, we used a vector search to find the similar previously asked questions and the queries / schemas they map to. In the case of a high probability of a match, the results can be pre-run with the stored query and passed to the LLM alongside the query. If the results can answer the question, query generation can be skipped all together, speeding up the total execution time.

In the case of an unknown question, there is a minor increase in latency but the query index cache could be pre-populated before it is released to users with common questions.

The following environmental variables control the behaviour of the Vector Based Text2SQL generation:

- **Text2Sql__UseQueryCache** - controls whether the query cached index is checked before using the standard schema index.
- **Text2Sql__PreRunQueryCache** - controls whether the top result from the query cache index (if enabled) is pre-fetched against the data source to include the results in the prompt.

## Plugins

### prompt_based_sql_plugin.py

The `./plugins/prompt_based_sql_plugin/prompt_based_sql_plugin.py` contains 3 key methods to power the Prompt Based Text2SQL engine.

#### system_prompt()

This method takes the loaded `entities.json` file and generates a system prompt based on it. Here, the **EntityName** and **Description** are used to build a list of available entities for the LLM to select.

This is then inserted into a pre-made Text2SQL generation prompt that already contains optimised and working instructions for the LLM. This system prompt for the plugin is added to the main prompt file at runtime.

The **target_engine** is passed to the prompt, along with **engine_specific_rules** to ensure that the SQL queries generated work on the target engine.

#### get_entity_schema()

This method is called by the Semantic Kernel framework automatically, when instructed to do so by the LLM, to fetch the full schema definitions for a given entity. This returns a JSON string of the chosen entity which allows the LLM to understand the column definitions and their associated metadata. This can be called in parallel for multiple entities.

#### run_sql_query()

This method is called by the Semantic Kernel framework automatically, when instructed to do so by the LLM, to run a SQL query against the given database. It returns a JSON string containing a row wise dump of the results returned. These results are then interpreted to answer the question.

### vector_based_sql_plugin.py

The `./plugins/vector_based_sql_plugin/vector_based_sql_plugin.py` contains 3 key methods to power the Vector Based Text2SQL engine.

#### system_prompt()

This method simply returns a pre-made system prompt that contains optimised and working instructions for the LLM. This system prompt for the plugin is added to the main prompt file at runtime.

The **target_engine** is passed to the prompt, along with **engine_specific_rules** to ensure that the SQL queries generated work on the target engine.

**If the query cache is enabled, the prompt is adjusted to instruct the LLM to look at the cached data and results first, before calling `get_entity_schema()`.**

#### get_entity_schema()

This method is called by the Semantic Kernel framework automatically, when instructed to do so by the LLM, to search the AI Search instance with the given text. The LLM is able to pass the key terms from the user query, and retrieve a ranked list of the most suitable entities to answer the question.

The search text passed is vectorised against the entity level **Description** columns. A hybrid Semantic Reranking search is applied against the **EntityName**, **Entity**, **Columns/Name** fields.

#### fetch_sql_queries_with_schemas_from_cache()

The vector based with query cache uses the `fetch_sql_queries_with_schemas_from_cache()` method to fetch the most relevant previous query and injects it into the prompt before the initial LLM call. The use of Auto-Function Calling here is avoided to reduce the response time as the cache index will always be used first.

If the score of the top result is higher than the defined threshold, the query will be executed against the target data source and the results included in the prompt. This allows us to prompt the LLM to evaluated whether it can use these results to answer the question, **without further SQL Query generation** to speed up the process.

#### run_sql_query()

This method is called by the Semantic Kernel framework automatically, when instructed to do so by the LLM, to run a SQL query against the given database. It returns a JSON string containing a row wise dump of the results returned. These results are then interpreted to answer the question.

Additionally, if any of the cache functionality is enabled, this method will update the query cache index based on the SQL query run, and the schemas used in execution.
