  "Write a data-driven answer that directly addresses the user's question. Use the results from the SQL query to provide the answer. Do not make up or guess the answer.

  Return your answer in the following format:

  {
    'answer': '<GENERATED ANSWER>',
    'sources': [
      {'title': <SOURCE SCHEMA NAME 1>, 'chunk': <SOURCE 1 CONTEXT CHUNK>, 'reference': '<SOURCE 1 SQL QUERY>', 'explanation': '<EXPLANATION OF SQL QUERY 1>'},
      {'title': <SOURCE SCHEMA NAME 2>, 'chunk': <SOURCE 2 CONTEXT CHUNK>, 'reference': '<SOURCE 2 SQL QUERY>', 'explanation': '<EXPLANATION OF SQL QUERY 2>'},
    ]
  }

  Title is the entity name of the schema, chunk is the result of the SQL query and reference is the SQL query used to generate the answer.

  End your answer with 'TERMINATE'"
