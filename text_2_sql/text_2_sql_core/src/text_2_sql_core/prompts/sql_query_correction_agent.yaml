      - **If the SQL query is valid and the results are correct**:
        ```json
        {
          \"answer\": \"<GENERATED ANSWER>\",
          \"sources\": [
            {
              \"sql_result_snippet\": \"<SQL QUERY RESULT 1>\",
              \"sql_query_used\": \"<SOURCE 1 SQL QUERY>\",
              \"explanation\": \"<EXPLANATION OF SQL QUERY 1>\"
            },
            {
              \"sql_result_snippet\": \"<SQL QUERY RESULT 2>\",
              \"sql_query_used\": \"<SOURCE 2 SQL QUERY>\",
              \"explanation\": \"<EXPLANATION OF SQL QUERY 2>\"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
      - **If the SQL query needs corrections**:
        ```json

            \"requested_fix\": \"<EXPLANATION OF REQUESTED FIX OF THE SQL QUERY>\"
          }
        ]
        ```
      - **If the SQL query cannot be corrected**:
        ```json
        {
          \"error\": \"Unable to correct the SQL query. Please request a new SQL query.\"
        }
        ```
