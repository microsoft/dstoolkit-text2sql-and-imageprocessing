# Multi-Shot Text2SQL Component

This portion of the repo contains code to implement a multi-shot approach to Text2SQL generation. This code can be integrated into a RAG application to allow the application to intelligently switch between different data sources (SQL, AI Search etc) to answer the question with the best possible information.

The implementation is written for [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) in Python, although it can easily be adapted for C# or another framework such as LangChain.

The sample provided works with Azure SQL Server, although it has been easily adapted to other SQL sources such as Snowflake.

**Three iterations on the approach are provided for SQL query generation. A prompt based approach and a two vector database based approaches. See Multi-Shot Approach for more details**

## High Level Workflow

The following diagram shows a workflow for how the Text2SQL plugin would be incorporated into a RAG application. Using the plugins available, alongside the [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) capabilities of LLMs, the LLM can do [Chain of Thought](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/conceptual/chain-of-thought-prompting) reasoning to determine the steps needed to answer the question. This allows the LLM to recognise intent and therefore pick appropriate data sources based on the intent of the question.

## Why Text2SQL instead of indexing the database contents?

Generating SQL queries and executing them to provide context for the RAG application provided several benefits in the use case this was designed for.

- Automatic report generation did not have to be built to automatically index the contents of the database and chunk it accordingly.
- By retaining the original table structure rather than indexing the contents, we are able to perform aggregations and calculations on the data quickly and accurately to answer numerical or statistic based questions. On a pure document based system, some of these questions are not easily answerable without pre-computing reports or extracting all the content
    - e.g. *What is our top performing sales per by quantity of units sold this month? What item did they sell the most of?* is answerable with a few simple SQL query if the correct views are exposed.
    - Without Text2SQL, a document needs to contain the top sales information for each month and be updated regularly. Additionally, we need to then store in a document all the relevant information for what they have sold that month and add into the chunk information that they are the top performing sales person.
- Pushing numerical calculations onto the source SQL engine ensures accuracy in the maths.
- Data can be updated real-time in the source database and be immediately accessible to the LLM.

## Multi-Shot Approach

A common way to perform Text2SQL generation _(Iteration 1)_ is to provide the complete schema information (either a full schema or a plain text description) inside the initial prompt. Whilst this works for small databases, there are issues with scalability as the number of tables and views exposed to the LLM increases:

- More tables / views significantly increases the number of tokens used within the prompt and the cost of inference.
- More schema information can cause confusion with the LLM. In our original use case, when exceeding 5 complex tables / views, we found that the LLM could get confused between which columns belonged to which entity and as such, would generate invalid SQL queries.

To solve these issues, a Multi-Shot approach is developed. Below is the iterations of development on the Text2SQL query component.

![Comparison between a common Text2SQL approach and a Multi-Shot Text2SQL approach.](./images/Text2SQL%20Approaches.png "Multi Shot SQL Approaches")

Three different iterations are presented and code provided for:
 - **Iteration 2:** Injection of a brief description of the available entities is injected into the prompt. This limits the number of tokens used and avoids filling the prompt with confusing schema information.
 - **Iteration 3:** Indexing the entity definitions in a vector database, such as AI Search, and querying it to retrieve the most relevant entities for the key terms from the query.
  - **Iteration 4:** Keeping an index of commonly asked questions and which schema / SQL query they resolve to - this index is generated by the LLM when it encounters a question that has not been previously asked. Additionally, indexing the entity definitions in a vector database, such as AI Search _(same as Iteration 3)_. First querying this index to see if a similar SQL query can be obtained _(if high probability of exact SQL query match, the results can be pre-fetched)_. If not, falling back to the schema index, and querying it to retrieve the most relevant entities for the key terms from the query.

All approaches limit the number of tokens used and avoids filling the prompt with confusing schema information.

Using Auto-Function calling capabilities, the LLM is able to retrieve from the plugin the full schema information for the views / tables that it considers useful for answering the question. Once retrieved, the full SQL query can then be generated. The schemas for multiple views / tables can be retrieved to allow the LLM to perform joins and other complex queries.

For the query cache enabled approach, AI Search is used as a vector based cache, but any other cache that supports vector queries could be used, such as Redis.

### Full Logical Flow for Vector Based Approach

The following diagram shows the logical flow within the Vector Based plugin. In an ideal scenario, the questions will follow the _Pre-Fetched Cache Results Path** which leads to the quickest answer generation. In cases where the question is not known, the plugin will fall back the other paths accordingly and generate the SQL query using the LLM. The cache is then updated with the newly generated query and schemas.

As the query cache is shared between users (no data is stored in the cache), a new user can benefit from the pre-mapped question and schema resolution in the index.

**Database results were deliberately not stored within the cache. Storing them would have removed one of the key benefits of the Text2SQL plugin, the ability to get near-real time information inside a RAG application. Instead, the query is stored so that the most-recent results can be obtained quickly. Additionally, this retains the ability to apply Row or Column Level Security.**

|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Advantages** | Fast for a limited number of entities. | Significant reduction in token usage. | Significant reduction in token usage. | Significant reduction in token usage.

### Complete Execution Time Comparison for Approaches

To compare the different in complete execution time, the following questions were tested 25 times each for 4 different approaches.

Approaches:
- Prompt-based Multi-Shot (Iteration 2)
- Vector-Based Multi-Shot (Iteration 3)
- Vector-Based Multi-Shot with Query Cache (Iteration 4)
- Vector-Based Multi-shot with Pre Run Query Cache (Iteration 4)

Questions:
- What is the total revenue in June 2008?
- Give me the total number of orders in 2008?
- Which country did had the highest number of orders in June 2008?

The graph below shows the response times for the experimentation on a Known Question Set (i.e. the cache has already been populated with the query mapping by the LLM). gpt-4o was used as the completion LLM for this experiment. The response time is the complete execution time including:

- Prompt Preparation
- Question Understanding
- Cache Index Requests _(if applicable)_
- SQL Query Execution
- Interpretation and generation of answer in the correct format

![Response Time Distribution](./images/Known%20Question%20Response%20Time.png "Response Time Distribution By Approach")

The vector-based cache approaches consistently outperform those that just use a Prompt-Based or Vector-Based approach by a significant margin. Given that it is highly likely the same Text2SQL questions will be repeated often, storing the question-sql mapping leads to **significant performance increases** that are beneficial, despite the initial additional latency (between 1 - 2 seconds from testing) when a question is asked the first time.

## Sample Output

### What is the top performing product by quantity of units sold?

#### SQL Query Generated

*SELECT TOP 1 ProductID, SUM(OrderQty) AS TotalUnitsSold FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail GROUP BY ProductID ORDER BY TotalUnitsSold DESC*

#### JSON Result

```json
{
    "answer": "The top-performing product by quantity of units sold is the **Classic Vest, S** from the **Classic Vest** product model, with a total of 87 units sold [1][2].",
    "sources": [
        {
            "title": "Sales Order Detail",
            "chunk": "| ProductID | TotalUnitsSold |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| 864       | 87             |\n",
            "reference": "SELECT TOP 1 ProductID, SUM(OrderQty) AS TotalUnitsSold FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail GROUP BY ProductID ORDER BY TotalUnitsSold DESC;"
        },
        {
            "title": "Product and Description",
            "chunk": "| Name           | ProductModel  |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| Classic Vest, S| Classic Vest  |\n",
            "reference": "SELECT Name, ProductModel FROM SalesLT.vProductAndDescription WHERE ProductID = 864;"
        }
    ]
}
```

The **answer** and **sources** properties can be rendered to the user to visualize the results. Markdown support is useful for complex answer outputs and explaining the source of the information.

## Data Dictionary

### entities.json

To power the knowledge of the LLM, a data dictionary containing all the SQL views / table metadata is used. Whilst the LLM could query the database at runtime to find out the schemas for the database, storing them in a text file reduces the overall latency of the system and allows the metadata for each table to be adjusted in a form of prompt engineering.

The data dictionary is stored in `./data_dictionary/entities.json`. Below is a sample entry for a view / table that we which to expose to the LLM. The Microsoft SQL Server [Adventure Works Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16) is used as an sample.

```json
{
    "EntityName": "Get All Categories",
    "Entity": "vGetAllCategories",
    "Description": "This view provides a comprehensive list of all product categories and their corresponding subcategories in the SalesLT schema of the AdventureWorksLT database. It is used to understand the hierarchical structure of product categories, facilitating product organization and categorization.",
    "Columns": [
        {
            "Definition": "A unique identifier for each product category. This ID is used to reference specific categories.",
            "Name": "ProductCategoryID",
            "Type": "INT"
        },
        {
            "Definition": "The name of the parent product category. This represents the top-level category under which subcategories are grouped.",
            "Name": "ParentProductCategoryName",
            "Type": "NVARCHAR(50)"
        },
        {
            "Definition": "The name of the product category. This can refer to either a top-level category or a subcategory, depending on the context.",
            "Name": "ProductCategoryName",
            "Type": "NVARCHAR(50)"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Property Definitions
- **EntityName** is a human readable name for the entity.
- **Entity** is the actual name for the entity that is used in the SQL query.
- **Description** provides a comprehensive description of what information the entity contains.
- **Columns** contains a list of the columns exposed for querying. Each column contains:
    - **Definition** a short definition of what information the column contains. Here you can add extra metadata to **prompt engineer** the LLM to select the right columns or interpret the data in the column correctly.
    - **Name** is the actual column name.
    - **Type** is the datatype for the column.
    - **SampleValues (optional)** is a list of sample values that are in the column. This is useful for instructing the LLM of what format the data may be in.
    - **AllowedValues (optional)** is a list of absolute allowed values for the column. This instructs the LLM only to use these values if filtering against this column.

A full data dictionary must be built for all the views / tables you which to expose to the LLM. The metadata provide directly influences the accuracy of the Text2SQL component.

## Prompt Based SQL Plugin (Iteration 2)

This approach works well for a small number of entities (tested on up to 20 entities with hundreds of columns). It performed well on the testing, with correct metadata, we achieved 100% accuracy on the test set.

Whilst a simple and high performing approach, the downside of this approach is the increase in number of tokens as the number of entities increases. Additionally, we found that the LLM started to get "confused" on which columns belong to which entities as the number of entities increased.

### prompt_based_sql_plugin.py

The `./plugins/prompt_based_sql_plugin/prompt_based_sql_plugin.py` contains 3 key methods to power the Prompt Based Text2SQL engine.

#### system_prompt()

This method takes the loaded `entities.json` file and generates a system prompt based on it. Here, the **EntityName** and **Description** are used to build a list of available entities for the LLM to select.

This is then inserted into a pre-made Text2SQL generation prompt that already contains optimised and working instructions for the LLM. This system prompt for the plugin is added to the main prompt file at runtime.

The **target_engine** is passed to the prompt, along with **engine_specific_rules** to ensure that the SQL queries generated work on the target engine.

#### get_entity_schema()

This method is called by the Semantic Kernel framework automatically, when instructed to do so by the LLM, to fetch the full schema definitions for a given entity. This returns a JSON string of the chosen entity which allows the LLM to understand the column definitions and their associated metadata. This can be called in parallel for multiple entities.

#### run_sql_query()

This method is called by the Semantic Kernel framework automatically, when instructed to do so by the LLM, to run a SQL query against the given database. It returns a JSON string containing a row wise dump of the results returned. These results are then interpreted to answer the question.

## Vector Based SQL Plugin (Iterations 3 & 4)

This approach allows the system to scale without significantly increasing the number of tokens used within the system prompt. Indexing and running an AI Search instance consumes additional cost, compared to the prompt based approach.

If the query cache is enabled, we used a vector search to find the similar previously asked questions and the queries / schemas they map to. In the case of a high probability of a match, the results can be pre-run with the stored query and passed to the LLM alongside the query. If the results can answer the question, query generation can be skipped all together, speeding up the total execution time.

In the case of an unknown question, there is a minor increase in latency but the query index cache could be pre-populated before it is released to users with common questions.

The following environmental variables control the behaviour of the Vector Based Text2SQL generation:

- **Text2Sql__UseQueryCache** - controls whether the query cached index is checked before using the standard schema index.
- **Text2Sql__PreRunQueryCache** - controls whether the top result from the query cache index (if enabled) is pre-fetched against the data source to include the results in the prompt.

### vector_based_sql_plugin.py

The `./plugins/vector_based_sql_plugin/vector_based_sql_plugin.py` contains 3 key methods to power the Vector Based Text2SQL engine.

#### Indexing

`./deploy_ai_search/text_2_sql.py` & `./deploy_ai_search/text_2_sql_query_cache.py` contains the scripts to deploy and index the data dictionary for use within the plugin. See instructions in `./deploy_ai_search/README.md`.

#### system_prompt()

This method simply returns a pre-made system prompt that contains optimised and working instructions for the LLM. This system prompt for the plugin is added to the main prompt file at runtime.

The **target_engine** is passed to the prompt, along with **engine_specific_rules** to ensure that the SQL queries generated work on the target engine.

**If the query cache is enabled, the prompt is adjusted to instruct the LLM to look at the cached data and results first, before calling `get_entity_schema()`.**

#### get_entity_schema()

This method is called by the Semantic Kernel framework automatically, when instructed to do so by the LLM, to search the AI Search instance with the given text. The LLM is able to pass the key terms from the user query, and retrieve a ranked list of the most suitable entities to answer the question.

The search text passed is vectorised against the entity level **Description** columns. A hybrid Semantic Reranking search is applied against the **EntityName**, **Entity**, **Columns/Name** fields.

#### fetch_queries_from_cache()

The vector based with query cache uses the `fetch_queries_from_cache()` method to fetch the most relevant previous query and injects it into the prompt before the initial LLM call. The use of Auto-Function Calling here is avoided to reduce the response time as the cache index will always be used first.

If the score of the top result is higher than the defined threshold, the query will be executed against the target data source and the results included in the prompt. This allows us to prompt the LLM to evaluated whether it can use these results to answer the question, **without further SQL Query generation** to speed up the process.

#### run_sql_query()

This method is called by the Semantic Kernel framework automatically, when instructed to do so by the LLM, to run a SQL query against the given database. It returns a JSON string containing a row wise dump of the results returned. These results are then interpreted to answer the question.

Additionally, if any of the cache functionality is enabled, this method will update the query cache index based on the SQL query run, and the schemas used in execution.

## Tips for good Text2SQL performance.

- Pre-assemble views to avoid the LLM having to make complex joins between multiple tables
- Give all columns and views / tables good names that are descriptive.
- Spend time providing good descriptions in the metadata for all entities and columns e.g.
    - If a column contains a value in a given currency, give the currency information in the metadata.
    - Clearly state in the **description** what sorts of questions a given view / table can provide answers for.
- Use common codes for columns that need filtering e.g.
    - A  country can have multiple text representations e.g. United Kingdom or UK. Use ISO codes for countries, instead of text descriptions to increase the likelihood of correct and valid SQL queries.

## Production Considerations

Below are some of the considerations that should be made before using this plugin in production:

- Despite prompting to only produce **SELECT** statements, there is a danger that dangerous SQL statements could be generated.
    - Consider adding validation of the SQL query before it is executed to check it is only performing actions that you allow.
    - Consider limiting the permissions of the identity or connection string to only allow access to certain tables or perform certain query types.
- If possible, run the queries under the identity of the end user so that any row or column level security is applied to the data.
- Consider data masking for sensitive columns that you do not wish to be exposed.
- The vector matching for the index could be run locally, rather than in an external service such as Azure AI Search. For speed of implementation, AI Search was used in this proof of concept.
