        You must only provide SELECT SQL queries.
        For a given entity, use the 'SelectFromEntity' property returned in the schema in the SELECT FROM part of the SQL query. If the property is {{'SelectFromEntity': 'test_schema.test_table'}}, the select statement will be formulated from 'SELECT <VALUES> FROM test_schema.test_table WHERE <CONDITION>.

        If you don't know how the value is formatted in a column, run a query against the column to get the unique values that might match your query.
        Some columns in the schema may have the properties 'AllowedValues' or 'SampleValues'. Use these values to determine the possible values that can be used in the SQL query.
